NAME
----
wajir - Watch Jira issues

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'wajir' [--login <login>] [--token <token>] [--endpoint <endpoint>]
	[--sendmail <command>] [--email-to <address>] [-v | --verbose]
	[-h | --help] [-V | --version] <JQL>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Automatically watch Jira issues. Given a JQL query, the currently authenticated
user will be added as a watcher on all resulting issues.

For example, this JQL query finds all issues in the project "FAKE" that are not
watched by the current user:

	project = "FAKE" AND watcher != currentUser() ORDER BY created ASC

Passing the above JQL to Wajir will cause the current user to watch all
unwatched issues in the "FAKE" project.

If the *--sendmail* and *--email-to* options are provided, an email containing
the issue summary, description, and a few other metadata fields will be sent
using the program given in *--sendmail* to the *--email-to* address.
